# after-action-report-script

This is a simple script I hacked together in [AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/).

When started, it will ask for a directory relation to the script location to save files.

When you push shift + F3, it will take a screenshot and then prompt for some text. It will save both in the specified directory.

It makes writing [after action reports](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AfterActionReport), where you tell the story of a full game of some sort.
